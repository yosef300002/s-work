        <p class="sh2">Ibn al-Qayyim said: “The heart becomes sick just as the body becomes sick, and its cure is in repentance and abstinence. It rusts just as a mirror rusts, and its polish is in remembrance. It becomes naked just as the body becomes naked, and its adornment is piety. It becomes hungry and thirsty just as the body becomes hungry, and its food and drink are knowledge, love, trust, repentance, and service.</p>

        <p class="sh1">The most beautiful sayings about repentance :</p>
        <p class="sh2">It is from the great mercy and generosity of Allah that He has made the door of repentance open to sinners. He accepts them if they return to Him sincerely, and He rejoices in their repentance, and guides and strengthens them. Repentance means abandoning sins and transgressions, returning to Allah - the Almighty - and resolving not to return to sin and returning rights to their owners. We mention below the most prominent influential sayings about repentance to Allah - the Almighty</p>
