            AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a fascinating and rapidly advancing field within the realm of programming. It involves the development of intelligent machines and software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI encompasses various techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, among others.
            
            Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Through training on large datasets, machines can recognize patterns, make classifications, and improve their performance over time</p>

        <p class="sh2">
            Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP is concerned with enabling computers to understand and interact with human language. It involves tasks like speech recognition, language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots. NLP has opened up new possibilities for human-computer interaction and has applications in virtual assistants, customer support, and content analysis.</p>
